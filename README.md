# miniS.py
## **About:**
This is a small program that runs totally on python 3. It is a payload and listener simillar Metasploit but smaller and is only used for monitoring.
It is mainly for Windows 10 and is untested on other versions of windows. In additon becuase this runs completely on Python, you and the target must have python
3 installed. The reason you might want to use this besides other tools is becuase it is not picked up by AV. You also have the power to view files and download them.
If you use this, Thank You!
